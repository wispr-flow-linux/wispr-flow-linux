them, they win. Read them before opening a non-trivial issue or PR.

- [`docs/reference/ipc-contract.md`](docs/reference/ipc-contract.md) — the IPC

  message shapes, keycodes (with companion `keycodes.json` / `commands.json`).
  The technical source of truth for helper behaviour.
- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) — what we accept, what goes upstream to
  Wispr, the bash + Rust style requirements, the AI-attribution policy.

## Project overview

This is an **unofficial** Linux port of the proprietary **Wispr Flow**
voice-dictation app (an Electron 42 / electron-forge app shipped as a Squirrel
Windows installer). It is two things:

1. A **repackaging pipeline** (`scripts/`, `build.sh`) that extracts the app,
   patches its bundle for Linux, rebuilds native modules, stages a Linux
   Electron, and produces `.deb` / `.rpm` / AppImage packages.
2. A **clean-room Rust helper** that reimplements the one native capability Wispr
   Flow ships only for macOS (Swift) and Windows (C#): injecting transcribed text
   into the focused application. It is built from the documented IPC contract
   (`docs/reference/`) and contains **no Wispr Flow code**. It now lives
   in its own repo (`wispr-flow-linux/helper`); see the Repo layout below.

## Repo layout

The project spans **two repositories** under the `wispr-flow-linux` org:

- **`wispr-flow-linux/wispr-flow-linux` (this repo)** — the public-domain build
  scripts and the local packaging makers.
- **`wispr-flow-linux/helper`** — the clean-room Rust helper. It was extracted
  from this repo and no longer lives here as a local source tree. The helper is
  consumed as a **prebuilt binary** pinned in `helper-version.txt` and staged
  via the `HELPER_BIN` env var (build-linux.sh resolves it).

> The hosted distribution layer — the `gh-pages` APT/DNF tree, the `v*` tag
> Releases, the publish/heartbeat workflows, and a `wispr-flow-linux/worker`
> Cloudflare Worker fronting `pkg.wispr-flow-linux.dev` — is maintainer-run
> and fails closed with no human gate (D-011). See `RELEASING.md` and the
> "Pull request policy" in `CONTRIBUTING.md` before touching it.

This repo's tree:

- `build.sh` — top-level orchestrator: dispatches the staging pipeline and the
  per-format packaging makers (`--build deb|rpm|appimage`, `--clean`,
  `--doctor`).
- `scripts/`
  - `setup/` — host detection, dependency install, Wispr Flow / Electron
    download helpers. `installer-pin.sh` is the pinned upstream installer
    (version, URL, sha256): builds download exactly that and verify it;
    only `check-wispr-version.yml` resolves upstream's `latest.json`
    (`resolve-installer-url.sh`) and rewrites the pin
    (`write-installer-pin.sh`).
  - `patches/` — the app patches: `helper-resolver.sh` (adds the `'linux'`
    helper-path branch), `mac-gates.sh` (gates the macOS Applications-folder
    guard to darwin), and the V8 14.8 `better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers` compat
    patch. `verify-patches.sh` static-greps the repacked bundle for the markers.
  - `packaging/` — `deb.sh`, `rpm.sh`, `appimage.sh` makers; shared signature
    `<maker>.sh <dist_dir> <version> <arch>`.
  - `launcher-common.sh` — the runtime `/usr/bin/wispr-flow` launcher library.
  - `doctor.sh` — the `wispr-flow --doctor` diagnostic surface.
  - `build-linux.sh` — the Phase-0 staging pipeline (see safety rules below).
- `helper-version.txt` — the pinned helper release tag fetched from the helper
  repo and staged via `HELPER_BIN`.
- `docs/reference/` — the documented stdin/fd-3 IPC protocol (`ipc-contract.md`
  + `keycodes.json` / `commands.json`).
- `tests/` — bats unit tests, per-format artifact tests, and the manual
  VM-matrix validators.
- `docs/` — building / configuration / troubleshooting / decisions / learnings /
  style guides.
- `nix/`, `flake.nix` — Nix packaging.
- `.github/workflows/` — CI gates (`shellcheck`, `codespell`, `test-flags`,
  `tests`) that run on every push/PR, plus the **tag-driven release/publish
  pipeline** (`ci.yml` build→test→release→APT→DNF→AUR, reusable
  `build-amd64`/`build-arm64`/`test-artifacts`, `check-wispr-version`,
  `apt-repo-heartbeat`, `cleanup-runs`, `update-flake-lock`). The publish chain
  runs on a `v*` tag push; see [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md). The worker lives
  in its own repo (`wispr-flow-linux/worker`).

## Code style

### Bash

All shell scripts follow the
[Bash Style Guide](docs/styleguides/bash_styleguide.md):

- Tabs for indentation, lines under 80 chars (exception: URLs and regex).
- `[[ ]]` for conditionals, `$(...)` for substitution.
- Single quotes for literals, double quotes for expansions.
- Lowercase variables; UPPERCASE only for constants/exports.
- `local` in functions. **No `set -e`** (it interacts badly with `$(...)`
  capture and function returns — check status explicitly: `cmd || handle_err`).
  No `eval`. No POSIX `[ ... ]`. No backticks.

Lint with `shellcheck` (and `actionlint` for workflows) before pushing. Fix the
underlying issue; a per-line `# shellcheck disable=SCXXXX` with a why-comment is
the last resort.

### Rust

The helper's code and its `cargo fmt` / `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D
warnings` / `cargo test` gates live in its own repo (`wispr-flow-linux/helper`).
This repo consumes the prebuilt binary pinned in `helper-version.txt`.

### Docs / CHANGELOG

- One declarative sentence then a code block or list at the top of every doc
  page — no "In this guide we will…" preamble.
- Lowercase kebab-case filenames in `docs/`. Order lives in `docs/index.md`.
- Troubleshooting headings are the literal symptom, not editorialized prose.
- `CHANGELOG.md` follows [Keep a Changelog
  1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/): bullets under
  Added/Fixed/Changed/etc.

## Learnings

The [`docs/learnings/`](docs/learnings/index.md) directory holds hard-won
technical knowledge from building the port — things not obvious from the code
alone. Consult the relevant entry before working on a subsystem; add a new entry
when you discover something non-obvious that would save the next contributor
(human or AI) significant time.

- [`kwin-zbus-tokio.md`](docs/learnings/kwin-zbus-tokio.md) — the async-zbus-on-
  tokio dispatch deadlock that left KDE active-app empty, and the fix.
- [`gnome-shell-extension.md`](docs/learnings/gnome-shell-extension.md) — install,
  relogin requirement, MRU focus fallback, the Introspect pivot.
- [`electron42-v8-sqlite.md`](docs/learnings/electron42-v8-sqlite.md) — the V8
  14.8 ABI patch that lets `better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers` compile.
- [`ispackaged-rename.md`](docs/learnings/ispackaged-rename.md) — why an
  `electron`-named launcher silently breaks DB migrations ("no such table").
- [`wayland-injection.md`](docs/learnings/wayland-injection.md) — in-process
  `/dev/uinput` virtual keyboard + `ext-data-control` clipboard.
- [`global-key-monitor.md`](docs/learnings/global-key-monitor.md) — push-to-talk
  and the shortcut recorder are fed by helper `KeypressEvent`s (XInput2 on X11,
  evdev `/dev/input` on Wayland); the app has no hotkey detection of its own.
- [`helper-spawn-env.md`](docs/learnings/helper-spawn-env.md) — the app spawns
  the helper with a replacement env (no `process.env`), starving it of
  `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`/`DISPLAY` so injection silently falls to the no-op `stub`
  while recording/shortcuts keep working; `helper-env.sh` restores the env.
- [`platform-gates.md`](docs/learnings/platform-gates.md) — the darwin/win32
  carve-outs Linux falls through: the `.linux`-matches-no-CSS-rule bug behind the
  shifted side menu, the three gate-shape rules (`isMac?:` is usually fine,
  `isWindows?:` lands Linux on mac defaults, `if(win32){}` no-else drops
  functionality), and beautifying the minified bundle with `prettier
  --ignore-path /dev/null` to re-audit a new Wispr version.
- [`patching-minified-js.md`](docs/learnings/patching-minified-js.md) — the
  rules for writing patches that survive re-minification: `[\w$]+` (not `\w`)
  for identifiers, anchor on developer strings over churning names, assert the
  match count, inject a marker for idempotency, and verify against shipped bytes
  (not a beautified copy). Read before touching `scripts/patches/`.
- [`test-methodology.md`](docs/learnings/test-methodology.md) — how a green
  shell test earns its colour: `run` subshells away counter mutations, anchors
  need a near-miss fixture, one FAIL branch must hit the real tool, `[PASS]`
  only on parsed data, and the mutation check (revert the fix, watch a test go
  red). Read before adding or reviewing a bats test.

## Cross-VM testing memory

Operational knowledge from manual VM validation (e.g. issue #32) lives in
[`.claude/memory/`](.claude/memory/) — **committed** so it carries across test
VMs and survives agent session resets (only `.claude/worktrees/` is gitignored).
Read it before doing VM validation work, and append new hard-won learnings there
(launch quirks, keybind/window/mic gotchas, per-issue validation status). It
complements `docs/learnings/` (code-level) with environment/runtime test
knowledge.

## GitHub / CI workflow

- Use the `gh` CLI for GitHub interactions.
- Branch off issue numbers: `fix/123-description` or `feature/123-description`.
- Reference issues in commits/PRs with `#123` or `Fixes #123`.
- CI gates (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): shellcheck, codespell, flag-parsing,
  and bats, run on every push/PR. On a `v*` tag, the same workflow runs the
  build→test→release→APT/DNF/AUR publish chain. See [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md).
- Claude Code hooks (`.claude/settings.json`): `.claude/hooks/pre-pr-lint.sh`
  runs the CI shellcheck line, codespell over tracked files, actionlint on
  changed workflows and (when a shell or bats file changed) `bats tests/*.bats`
  before any `git push`, and blocks the push on a failure;
  `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` installs the missing tools at session start
  with a passwordless sudo, or says which are missing.

### Issues, PRs, and commits

Keep them short and plain. An issue says what is wrong and what should be
true instead, in a few sentences. A PR says what changed and why this way,
enough for a reviewer to decide where to look. The evidence (test counts,
command output, the reasoning that ruled out the obvious approach) goes in
the commit body, where someone deep-diving is already reading, and the diff
is the authority over both. No headers, no checklists, no bullet retelling of
the diff, no em-dashes. Say what was deliberately left out.

Reference the issue with `Fixes #123` (or `Refs #123`). A commit subject
states what changed; the body states why, with the evidence. Credit reused or
cherry-picked contributor work by handle, in the body.

AI-assisted work discloses with one trailer line at the end of a PR or issue
body, using the actual model name:

```
Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

Commits carry `Co-Authored-By: Claude <claude@anthropic.com>`. Comments carry
no trailer.
