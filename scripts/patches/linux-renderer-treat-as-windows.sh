# linux-renderer-treat-as-windows.sh
#
# Makes a Wispr Flow RENDERER bundle (.webpack/renderer/<window>/index.js) treat
# Linux like Windows for its platform-conditional UI, WITHOUT lying to the
# preload-exposed bridge. It widens the single place each renderer reads the
# bridged `isWindows` boolean into a module-local, so every downstream consumer
# of that local takes the Windows branch on Linux too.
#
# WHY THIS PATCH EXISTS  (and why it replaces linux-platform-bool.sh)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# The renderer reads platform once, near the top of its main module:
#     const <obj> = window.electron,
#           <mac> = <obj>?.platform?.isMacOS  ?? !1,   // isMacOS  local
#           <win> = <obj>?.platform?.isWindows ?? !1;  // isWindows local
# On Linux BOTH booleans are false, so every `<win> ? winThing : macThing`
# consumer lands on the macOS default -- wrong for Linux. The audited consumers
# (re-verified against the shipped renderer bundles) are ALL ones where Linux
# correctly wants the Windows branch, and NONE is a Windows-only API call, store
# link, registry/UAC path, or "Windows" product branding (the renderer is UI
# only; the OS-API danger class lives in the MAIN bundle and gates on
# `process.platform`/`H8`, which this patch never touches):
#
#   * fresh-install default keyboard / PTT shortcut maps  (Ctrl/Win/Alt set)
#   * keyboard key-glyph labels                           (Windows glyphs)
#   * onboarding "Permissions" step gating
#       `<mac> || (<win> && !e.windowsHasMicPermission)`  (show the step)
#   * the mic-permission help asset                       (windows_mic_permissions)
#   * a couple of minor UI timings/props (recording-start delay, voiceProfile)
#
# The OLD patch (linux-platform-bool.sh, marker WISPR_LINUX_AS_WINDOWS) achieved
# this by flipping the PRELOAD boolean so `window.electron.platform.isWindows`
# returned `true` on Linux. That works but LIES on the documented bridge API:
# `platform.isWindows` is meant to report the real OS, and any FUTURE renderer
# site that reads it (correct branding, a Store link, a "Windows key" label)
# would silently fire on Linux. This patch instead leaves the bridge HONEST
# (`isWindows` stays `false` on Linux) and widens only the renderer-internal
# "treat as windows" local.
#
# THE FIX (one robust anchor per renderer)
# ----------------------------------------
# Widen the `isWindows` bind to also be true when the OS is linux, deriving the
# linux check from the SAME bridge object the bind already reads:
#
#     <obj>?.platform?.isWindows??!1
#       becomes
#     ((<obj>?.platform?.isWindows??!1)||"linux"===<obj>?.platform?.os)
#
# The inner parens are REQUIRED: JS forbids mixing `??` with `||` without
# grouping (`a ?? b || c` is a SyntaxError). `<obj>` is the minified
# window.electron local, which we read back out of the match rather than
# hardcoding. `platform.os` is the real OS string the bridge already exposes
# (left untouched), so no new bridge surface is needed. isMacOS is NOT touched
# (keeps Linux on the Ctrl / Windows-VK keycode side).
#
# ANCHORING (survives re-minification)
# ------------------------------------
# The anchor is the PRESERVED developer property chain `?.platform?.isWindows`
# plus the `??!1` default -- property names are not mangled by the current
# bundler, so this survives re-minification (or fails closed). The only minified
# token we touch (`<obj>`) is captured from the match and re-emitted verbatim, so
# nothing minified is hardcoded. The bind occurs EXACTLY ONCE per renderer that
# reads platform; we assert that and bail otherwise.
#
# Usage: linux-renderer-treat-as-windows.sh <path-to-renderer/<window>/index.js>
