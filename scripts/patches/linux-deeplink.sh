# linux-deeplink.sh -- fix cold-start `wispr-flow:` deep-link handling on Linux
# in the Wispr Flow main bundle (.webpack/main/index.js).
#
# WHY THIS PATCH EXISTS
# ---------------------
# Wispr Flow registers itself as the `wispr-flow:` protocol handler
# (setAsDefaultProtocolClient("wispr-flow")) and routes inbound deep links to a
# dispatcher (the minified `L(...)`). There are THREE delivery paths:
#
#   * macOS  -> the `open-url` Electron event (handled, platform-correct).
#   * already-running app (any OS) -> the `second-instance` event, which scans
#       the new instance's argv for a `wispr-flow:` URL. That handler IS
#       platform-neutral in practice -- but note its inner argv scan is ALSO
#       wrapped in `if(<isWin32>){...}` (see below), so on Linux a deep link to
#       an already-running app falls through to the "focus the window" branch
#       and the URL payload is dropped too. We do NOT touch that site here.
#   * COLD START (app not yet running) -> on Windows AND Linux the OS launches
#       the app with the `wispr-flow:` URL appended to process.argv. The bundle
#       parses it out at startup with:
#
#         if(<isWin32>){
#           const e=B(process.argv.find(e=>
#             e.startsWith("wispr-flow:")||e.startsWith("wispr-flow/")));
#           e&&L(e);
#         }
#
#       This block is gated to win32 ONLY. macOS doesn't need it (it uses
#       open-url), but Linux DOES -- Linux delivers protocol URLs via argv just
#       like Windows. So launching from a `wispr-flow:` link while the app is
#       NOT running silently drops the URL on Linux. That is the bug.
#
# Confirmed against the shipped minified bytes (extract/.../main/index.js):
#   ...quitting"),void e.app.quit();if(f.H8){const e=B(process.argv.find(
#       e=>e.startsWith("wispr-flow:")||e.startsWith("wispr-flow/")));e&&L(e)}
#       e.app.on("second-instance",(t,r)=>{ ...
# where `f.H8` resolves to the win32 flag (`H8:()=>c` with
# `c="win32"===process.platform`; cf. `d.H8?"windows":d.tD?"macos"` and the
# `tD`=darwin flag used by helper-resolver.sh). `process.argv.find` occurs
# EXACTLY ONCE in the whole bundle, so it uniquely pins the cold-start site and
# can never collide with the `second-instance` handler (which scans `r.find`).
#
# THE PATCH (surgical, one site)
# ------------------------------
# Widen the win32 guard at THAT site only, so Linux is included:
#
#   if(f.H8){const e=B(process.argv.find(...
#     becomes
#   if(f.H8||"linux"===process.platform){/*WISPR_LINUX_DEEPLINK*/const e=B(...
#
# We anchor on `process.argv.find` (a stable developer API call, unique in the
# bundle) and capture the preceding `if(<winflag>){` -- where <winflag> is a
# minified `obj.prop` accessor we read back out of the match rather than
# hardcoding -- then rewrite just the `{` that opens that block. This cannot
# regress Windows (f.H8 still wins) or macOS (neither branch is true; open-url
# is unaffected). It does NOT touch any Squirrel/registry win32 logic elsewhere
# that may share the same flag, because the edit is scoped to the single
# `process.argv.find` cold-start site.
#
# Usage: linux-deeplink.sh [path-to-.webpack/main/index.js]

# `process.argv.find` plus the `wispr-flow:` scheme literal that follows it --
